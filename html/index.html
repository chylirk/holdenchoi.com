              Retrospect is an open source framework for distributed backend tracing and 
              front-end session recording. It allows web developers to easily debug their 
              applications by abstracting away the complexity of tracing instrumentation.

          <h1>More About Me</h1>
          <p>I love to make things. I love to solve problems. Some of my favorite things to do are hiking 
            in the mountains and solving the daily NYT Crossword (not at the same time).  
          </p>
          <p>I have backgrounds in music composition, 
            and interaction design. Prior to becoming a software engineer, I was a stay at home mom. I wrote an article
            on Medium about my career transition, which you can read 
            <a href="https://medium.com/launch-school/rebuilding-a-career-after-stay-at-home-parenthood-abffd48f9269" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>My love for developing software includes everything from OO design through debugging and load testing. I
            appreciate elegant code and learning new algorithms. I'm 
            happiest when working with a team of developers and enjoy the experience of co-creation and collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>I can do the whole stack, however I'm most experienced with backend development. I am fluent
            in Javascript, but also have experience with Ruby and Go. On the frontend, I have worked with 
            React/Redux, Vanilla JS, Handlebars, JQuery, CSS and HTML5. On the backend, I have worked with Node JS and 
            Sinatra.  
          </p>
          <p>I also have experience working within the AWS ecosystem, specifically ECS, EC2, Lambda, Fargate, 
            Elasticache and S3, as well as working with Docker containers.</p>
